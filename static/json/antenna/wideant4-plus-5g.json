        "Description",
        "WideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} by WirEng® is a 5G and 4G true ±45° MIMO (45° clockwise and 45° counter-clockwise wave polarizations), fully enclosed, all-weather, ultra-linear, larger Quad Antenna for outdoor/pole/mast installations.The WideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} represents a true technological breakthrough as one of the widest-band antennas in the world as of today.\nWideAnt4-Plus-5G™ can be used with a variety of other 5G, 4G, 3G, and 2G radio equipment systems other than {modem}, including MIMO modems, hotspots, and routers (as external antennas) and with many other applications in the 450MHz to 6000MHz range.\nThe WideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} is fully enclosed and all-weather resistant, and is ideal for MIMO devices because it captures and transmits waves in two different polarization modes, as per MIMO-devices standards.WideAnt4-Plus-5G™ can also be used with other dual-antenna-port devices such as Aux/Diversity devices.\nThe connectors on WideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} are 24K gold-plated N female for maximum bandwidth and power transfer. Industrial-strength stainless steel Single-to-Quad Antenna pole mount adapter included. One-year warranty period included."

        "Main Features and Benefits",
        "WideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} is an elegant, larger, fully enclosed, powerful directional Quad Antenna that truly captures and transmits both +45° and -45° waves independently, as per strict MIMO standards (two cables required to connect to a MIMO device, not included).\nWideAnt4-Plus-5G™ features 24K gold plated N-Female connectors built directly on the antennas' bodies for maximum power transfer and bandwidth, and includes WirEng®'s excusive industrial-strength, stainless steel single-to-dual pole adapter (pole/mast not included).\nWideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} can be used with other 5G and 4G MIMO modems, hotspots, routers, and M2M devices (device-specific adapters not included).\nWideAnt4-Plus-5G™ is compatible with virtually all cellular bands worldwide and represents a true breakthrough in antenna technology because of its ultra-wide bandwidth and efficiency.\nWideAnt4-Plus-5G™ for {modem} operating frequency range is 450-6000 MHz with a peak gain of (varies) dBi*, a horizontal aperture of 45° and a vertical aperture of 35°. The connectors are N Female (24K Au). The nominal impedance is 50/75 Ohm (SKU WDP4-5G-NFG).\nWideAnt4-Plus-5G™ is mainly recommended for outdoors (pole/mast) applications.\n*Gain in dBi values are average increases obtained by comparing the standard/internal device antenna to a properly-installed WideAnt4-5G™ located substantially higher than the device location.\nThe WideAnt4-5G™ for {modem} measures 21.6 x 24 x 22 inches (55 x 61 x 56 cm) and weighs 9.1 lbs (4.1 kg). Made one by one with great care and skilled craftsmanship. One year manufacturer warranty included."
